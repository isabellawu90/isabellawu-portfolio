    "about": "So to introduce a little bit of information about me and my background... \n\n\nI'm Isabella/Izzy Wu! I am currently a senior at Cornell University School of Engineering majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am from Philadelphia, PA and own a 1 year old black cat who I adore. I love trying new food, exploring my tastes in fashion and interior design, meeting and learning about cats, and trying new styles of dance (freestyle, hip-hop, ballet, contemporary) and learning choreography. My parents are first generation immigrants and came here to the United States of America from China over two decades ago. I chose to study CS and Engineering because I always felt inclined towards STEM related subjects and knew that CS/Engineering would push my academic abilities and goals. I also explored my interests and built my teamwork skills by partaking in various extracurriculars on campus related to STEM such as SWE at Cornell and WICC (Women In Computing Cornell). I highly value mentorship, both being a mentor and mentee, and supporting up and coming generations of women and minorities in STEM. Software engineering is my intended and planned career field to enter as now because it both felt applicable to what I have learned and college and I enjoy the creativity, challenge, and collaboration it provides me. I hope everyone can enjoy my website and please do not hesitate to reach out to me!",
